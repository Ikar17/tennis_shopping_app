# Tennis Shopping App

## Project Description
This project is a simple app for my university, focusing on tennis accessories. The shopping app will have four categories: tennis rackets, clothes, shoes and other accessories (such as balls, strings etc.). Users will be able to shop as registered users or guests. It will be possible to store selected products in a shopping basket. The app will have two account types: user and admin with admin panel. The admin panel will enable to add, edit and delete products, view orders and update their status.
